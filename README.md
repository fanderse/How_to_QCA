# How_to_QCA (NOT MAINTAINED SINCE 2019!)
This repository hosts an R markdown file in which some essential steps for performing QCA in R using the QCApro package
are described. Furthermore, it includes a handy shiny application with which users can make themselved acquainted with the
transformation techniques required for performing QCA. Lastly, the markdown file also includes custom made plots created
using ggplot2 for a fancy way to present results (these plots also replace the XYplot function from the QCA package).
